The DNA Methylation script will perform a basic DNA methylation analysis on all .fastq files in the specified directory. The results will be stored in the output directory. Please make sure to adjust the paths and parameters according to your specific setup and needs.
Remember, this is just a basic example. Depending on your specific needs and the complexity of your project, you might need to modify this script or use more advanced tools or techniques. Always make sure to check the documentation of the tools you are using to understand their capabilities and limitations. If you are not sure how to proceed, consider seeking help from a bioinformatics expert or a relevant online community.
